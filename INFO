Assignment 0:
1. Change the output to indicate the sum of all preferences achieved for each group. In Matching the employees achieved (2+2+1+1 = 6) and the applicants achieved (3+3+3+3=12)
    def calculate_preference_sum(person_dict):
    sum_of_preferences = 0
    for person in person_dict.values():
        if person.partner:
            sum_of_preferences += person.rank
    return sum_of_preferences

    print("Sum of preferences for employers:", calculate_preference_sum(employers))
    print("Sum of preferences for applicants:", calculate_preference_sum(applicants))
2. Create an example for which the results are the same, no matter who proposes.
    For this segment of the assignment I kept the same structures from match.py and match2.py but adjusted the txt files
    (ApplicantsEX.txt and EmployersEX.txt) With this I decided to make each side equal 8 for a total of 16. I played with
    the original files however I could not find a solution where the sums were equal. Whereas in the data pools that I
    created I was able to manually adjust them to ensure that both sides had the same sums. I do think that it would be
    possible to have the sums equal to each other without composing my own data file however, it would change a bit of
    the original algorithm. I also created a version with two applicants and two employers which was much easier to make
    the sums equal.
    The Applicant file I created:
        a: E,H,G,F
        b: E,F,G,H
        c: F,G,E,H
        d: G,E,H,F
    The Employer File I created:
        E: a,b,c,d
        F: c,b,d,a
        G: a,c,b,d
        H: c,a,d,b
